# QuickBite üçî

A modern and responsive food delivery application concept, built from the ground up with React and TypeScript. This project simulates the core user experience of a food delivery platform, from browsing restaurants to completing a simulated checkout.

The main goal was to build a feature-rich Single Page Application (SPA) to practice and demonstrate key frontend development concepts, including global state management, dynamic routing, and component-based architecture.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Restaurant Showcase:** A dynamic gallery on the home page that displays a list of available restaurants.
* **Detailed Restaurant Menu:** Clicking on a restaurant leads to a dedicated page with its unique menu, fetched dynamically based on the URL parameter.
* **Functional Shopping Cart:** A globally managed shopping cart with full functionality:
    * Add items from any menu.
    * Increment and decrement item quantities.
    * Remove items completely.
* **Persistent State:** The shopping cart's state is saved to `localStorage`, meaning the user's selections are remembered even after closing or refreshing the browser tab.
* **Simulated Checkout Flow:** A complete user journey from cart to a checkout form and a final "Thank You" confirmation page.
* **Seamless Navigation:** Built as a true Single Page Application using `react-router-dom` for instant, smooth navigation between pages without reloads.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

This project was built using a modern set of tools and libraries for frontend development:

* **React:** A library for building user interfaces with a component-based architecture.
* **TypeScript:** Ensures type safety and code robustness, preventing common bugs.
* **Vite:** A blazing-fast build tool for the development environment.
* **Zustand:** A minimalist and powerful global state manager used for the shopping cart.
* **React Router DOM:** For implementing client-side routing and navigation.
* **CSS Modules:** For component-scoped and conflict-free styling.
